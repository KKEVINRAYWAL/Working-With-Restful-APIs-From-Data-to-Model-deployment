### Volatility Forecasting with GARCH Model: Working with RESTFUL APIs.

In this project, we have combined the fields of data engineering, data science, and model deployment to create a powerful tool for predicting volatility in financial markets. Our primary goal was to build a GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model that can forecast volatility, a crucial factor for investors in making informed decisions.

Here's an overview of what this project entails:

Data Collection: We sourced financial market data from the AlphaVantage API. This data includes historical price information for various stocks, which serves as the foundation for our volatility predictions.

Data Storage: To efficiently manage and analyze the large volume of financial data, we stored it in a SQL database. This database enables us to query and extract relevant information effectively.

GARCH Model Training: We implemented and trained a GARCH model using the historical price data. GARCH models are widely used for capturing volatility patterns in financial time series data, making them ideal for our volatility forecasting needs.

Model Deployment: To put our GARCH model into practical use, we developed a user-friendly API. This API allows users to interact with our model and receive real-time volatility predictions for the stocks of interest.

By combining these elements, we have created a comprehensive solution for volatility forecasting. In this README.md, we will guide you step-by-step through our project, detailing the data collection process, database setup, GARCH model training, and the deployment of the API.
